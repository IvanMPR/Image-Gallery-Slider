Images gallery slider, another classical component of many web pages.
Slides can be changed in three ways, by clicking on the arrows inside of the images container,
by clicking on the dots in the lower middle part of the image container, and by pressing the 
left or right arrow key on the keyboard.

Main principle of the sliding images is the manipulation of their transform: translateY property.
